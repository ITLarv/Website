# CUSTOM THINGS

## CSS/SASS/SCSS

This project is using SASS/SCSS for css handling.
Best tip is to use Visual Studio Code when changing CSS and installing the Extension ´Live Sass Compiler´.
Then make sure to activate "Watch Sass" in the bottom window toolbar before start editing any CSS.
The result CSS file will be a minified version inside the css-folder. This should be imported in the App.js(x) file.
App.css is also automatically created, but is mostly for readability if someting behaves unexpectedly.

NOTE: ONLY the .scss files should be edited together with a sass compiler. Any other code will be overridden.
