See the list below for a complete description of the different types of volunteers and their tasks.",
		"INFO_2": "Since most volunteers are appointed a few months before LARV they are not primarily involved in planning the project. Instead, as a volunteer you have an impact on the project through evaluations, workshops and direct contact with the person in charge of your department. The period of involvement and work load is for a volunteer generally the shortest and mildest out of the commitments that LARV offers. Again, this depends greatly on the type of volunteer you are looking to become. Expected working hours amount to 5 hours a week but usually less.
