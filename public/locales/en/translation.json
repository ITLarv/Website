		"INFO": "LARV, short for Luleå arbetsmarknadsvecka, is the largest event held annually at Luleå university of technology. This LARV takes place on January 18-23, 2021, with the fair itself on the 20th. LARV is a project dedicated to help students advance their professional careers and to help employers find the competence of tomorrow.

		"HEADER": "About LARV",
		"INFO_1": "LARV, short for Luleå arbetsmarknadsvecka, is a series of events held annually at Luleå university of technology. LARV has since 1983 been hosted by the student union of engineering and is a project with the purpose to help students advance their professional careers and to prepare them for life after graduation. For many years the project has kept growing and does today involve over 110 exhibitors, 2000+ students and grosses close to 3 Mkr in revenue. This makes it the most comprehensive event at LTU.",
		"INFO_2": "The acronym LARV roughly translates to Luleå career week. As the name suggests, the project is mostly about planning a week dedicated to student career development. Usually occurring during the 3rd week of january, LARV provides events such as inspiring seminars, workshops, career coaching, individual meetings between students and exhibitors. The largest event held during LARV is the LARV-fair. This fair acts as a platform for students and companies to truly get to know each other. The fair is a one day event and ends with a grand banquet which every company and involved student is invited to attend.",
		"INFO_3": "Prep-week is another major part of the project. This is a week held a couple of months before main week with the intent to prepare students for LARV. This is done through informative seminars regarding LARV, how to present yourself to companies, how to get started with and use LinkedIn, how to write a cover letter and other events in the same category.",

	"FAIR": {
		"HEADER": "The Fair",
		"INFO_1": "The LARV fair is LARV's main event. This is a day event where representatives from over 110 exhibitors normally travel to Luleå University of Technology to meet tomorrow's skills, the campus students. Ahead of LARV 2021, which will take place between 18–23 January, the LARV trade fair will be digital. We will use a platform from the company Graduateland. As a participant, you get your own digital stand in which you can fill in general information about your company or organization such as who you are, what you do, what services you offer, what people you are looking for and more. You have the opportunity to present pre-recorded videos and hold live seminars, but also to chat directly with the students via text chats or video calls. We have material that describes the platform and shows its design below.",
		"INFO_2": "The LARV fair takes place on January 20 between Kl. 9-16. Due to the importance of the fair, all students studying at the Faculty of Engineering have no scheduled lessons for that day.",
		"HEADER_2": "Pros and cons of a digital platform",
		"INFO_3": "With this year's digital platform, the recruitment aspect becomes more efficient as the platform through search functions and filters allows you to directly see if a candidate is interesting to you as you can see education, CV, other knowledge, nationality and more directly.",
		"INFO_4": "Measuring the outcome of a physical trade fair participation is often difficult, but with this year's digital platform, we have the opportunity to see exactly how many students have visited your stand, what programs they study, what they are interested in and much more. We can in a concrete way measure the outcome and value of participation at the fair and more easily follow up the work with interesting candidates.",
		"INFO_5": "For participants who would otherwise travel far, the cost will ultimately be less as representatives do not have to take time from their everyday tasks to travel. A digital participation basically only requires that representatives have a computer with an internet connection available while your stand is live to be able to answer questions and make any calls. Where in the country they are does not matter, head office as a business trip.",
		"INFO_6": "However, the employer branding part is not as strong with a digital platform as with a physical trade fair, so this year's trade fair package includes marketing in our digital trade fair catalog as well as extra marketing before the trade fair but also free access to the Individual Meetings service. This is a service that allows you to directly talk to selected, interesting students on a deeper level. We have chosen to include more in this year's trade fair package as we still want to offer the exposure and personal contact that is normally one of LARV's cornerstones.",
		"INFO_7": "Are you an organization that wants to participate in LARV? Read more information about organizational participation on our Exhibitor page...",
		"HEADER_3": "After the fair",
		"INFO_8": "After the end of the fair day at 16:00, it will no longer be possible to start new conversations between students and companies. However, you can continue the conversations started during the day for another week. After the fair, participating companies will be offered to receive detailed statistics from the fair day. This includes, among other things, how many students the stand attracted, what educations and year they study, how many chats were started and jobs applied for and more. A perfect tool to use to analyze and evaluate marketing strategies and, regardless of outcome, give you the best possible conditions for success even better at the next trade fair!"
