			<h1>Individual meetings</h1>
			<p>
				Individual meetings is a service which is highly appreciated by both
				students and organizations. Individual meetings allows representatives
				from your organization to sit down and have personal talks with students
				in a private, relaxed environment. This is a great way to find possible
				future colleagues and get to know what students prioritize when looking
				at employers. The meetings are 30 minutes long and you will be given a
				room for the whole day of the fair where you can conduct as many
				meetings as you can manage.
			</p>
			<p>
				If your organization want to participate in the meetings you will send
				us specifics regarding what types of student you preferably would like
				to talk to. When the students sign up for the meetings they will provide
				us with a CV. We will then select the appropriate students for your
				meetings. The price for this service is 4000kr for the whole day.{" "}

				open.
