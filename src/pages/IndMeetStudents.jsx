			<h1>Individual meetings</h1>
			<p>
				Individual meetings is your chance to have in depth conversations with
				representatives from certain organisations and get your foot through the
				door at your future employer. This service is for students who are
				interested in knowing more about specific employers and what
				opportunities they can offer them. The meetings are structured much like
				a casual job interview. You and the representative are free to talk
				about anything you feel is relevant.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you sign up for a meeting you will have the option to choose which
				organizations you would like to have meetings with. You will have to
				provide us with a CV so we can make sure that you and the organization's
				interests are inline with each other. The meetings are about 30 minutes
				long and you can book as many meetings as you can manage. However, you
				can only book one meeting per organization.
			</p>

				Interested in booking a meeting? Tell us you are interested by filling
				out the form below. We will get back to you as soon as the participating
				organizations has been determined.
