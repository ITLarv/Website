			<h1>The fair</h1>
			<p>
				The LARV-fair is perhaps the event which provides the most value during
				LARV and is a must for organizations that are serious about recruiting
				and introducing themselves to students. Many students which attend LARV
				are not informed about all the different opportunities which exists post
				graduation. By meeting them early in their career you can make a lasting
				impression and provide your organization with new thinking and ambition.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				The fair often attracts over 2000 students and is usually held on the
				wednesday of the career week between 9 AM - 15 PM. Exhibitor
				representatives are expected to be available in their stall ready to
				interact with students during a majority of this time. Because of the
				importance of the fair all students which study programs of technical
				faculty does not have any scheduled classes for that day. The fair is
				hosted at the campus and therefore utilizes a couple of its buildings.
				Because of this the available space is limited and not all exhibitors
				which wants to attend can be accommodated. Make sure that your
				organization notifies us as soon as possible to increase the chances of
				securing a spot for this years fair!
