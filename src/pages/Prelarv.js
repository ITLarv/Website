				Prep-week is another major part of the LARV project. This is a week held
				a couple of months before main week with the intent to prepare students
				for LARV. This is done through informative seminars regarding LARV, how
				to present yourself to companies, how to get started with and use
				LinkedIn, how to write a cover letter etc.. By hosting Prep-week
				awareness of LARV is increased and the students are made sure to be
				prepared to meet the attending organizations during LARV.{" "}
